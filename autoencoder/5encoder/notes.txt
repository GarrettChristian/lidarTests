Bump up all sizes
Need to go really big 

Try something huge first 
Needs a lot of data 

try 20 thousand 200 thousand 



MNIST could be better example

last of encoder to match the first layer of descoder 


big jumps are bad 
first 




All the powers of 2 until you hit the output 
64 - 512 


Generating cubes 
not enough capative 

rounding or coursoin error 
with my data before 


in mnist each region has a defined area
give consistent orientation 


Could be ordered z value check later 


in lidar format, don't have to pad with 0's 
missing is infinity 



Get raw data, so I don't have to resize

Invariant data, same sizes
